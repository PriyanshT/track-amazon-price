# Track the price of Amazon Product!
## Let's create a python application for windows to track the book `A Song of Ice and Fire`

To get started, we need to have pip installed for windows.<br>
If you don't have idea what pip is... then you don't know what pip is!!! (Google it!)<br>

Open Command Prompt and type the following:<br>
`pip install requests bs4`
<br><br>

Here, I am going to keep the track of price for <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Song-Ice-Fire-Thrones-Complete/dp/0007477155/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ILLV1VL7EKH8&keywords=a+song+of+ice+and+fire&qid=1568283272&s=gateway&sprefix=a+song%2Caps%2C278&sr=8-1">this</a> item
